Each column is a sample, and each row is the count for an ASV.'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 3\n  name  water_sample_10_m water_sample_20_m\n  <chr>             <dbl>             <dbl>\n1 ASV_1                28                14\n2 ASV_2                 5                12\n3 ASV_3                 0                 3\n4 ASV_4                14                41\n5 ASV_5                18                28\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Species richness\n\nA straightforward way of describing a microbial community is to count how many different species/ASV we have in a sample.\nThis metric is called **species richness**. Let's determine the species richness of the water sample at 10 m.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspecies_richness_10_m <- asv_counts |> \n  select(water_sample_10_m) |>\n  filter(water_sample_10_m > 0) |> \n  nrow()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe water sample at 10 m has a species richness of 4.\n\n",
