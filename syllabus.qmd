# Introduction

## Land Acknowledgement

UBC's Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the [xÊ·mÉ™Î¸kÊ·É™yÌ“É™m (Musqueam)](https://www.musqueam.bc.ca/) people.
The land it is situated on has always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the next on this site.

## TL;DR

## Instructor information

Hi ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Stephan Koenig, I use [He, Him pronouns](https://equity.ubc.ca/resources/gender-diversity/pronouns/), and I am a son, brother, cousin, husband, and father.
I am an evolutionary biologist by training and a self-taught data scientist, a jack of all trades and master of none, a teacher and a student.
I previously worked as a PostDoc Teaching and Learning Fellow in the Microbiology and Immunology Department at the University of British Columbia (UBC), coordinating the [EDUCE initiative](https://educe-ubc.github.io).
As a [Skylight](https://skylight.science.ubc.ca) Science Education Specialist in the Computer Science Department at UBC, I think about how modern computational tools can enhance teaching and learning.
I often fantasize about unshackling files from directories and love the colour orange, pour-over coffee & Markdown.
