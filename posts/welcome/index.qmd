# Welcome to MICB 2XX!

I am excited to welcome you to MICB 2XX and congratulations for making it in the MICB program!
This short announcement is here to get you oriented to this course website and point out some important resources. The landing page contains the [schedule](/index.qmd) where you can see all the things happening in the weeks to come. Then
take a look at the [syllabus](/syllabus.qmd) to gain an overview of the course and its requirements, but we will discuss it in the first class.

Oh, and if you have a GitHub.com account, please feel free to introduce yourself in the comment section. If you do not have an account yet, don't worry! We will learn soon how to set one up!
