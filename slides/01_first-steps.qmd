# Mini lesson:<br>Reproducible reporting of computational analyses {background-color="#faa928"}

## Learning outcomes

-   Describe why combining natural language and code enables reproducible analysis and research.

-   Discover how symbols and text convey formatting and the structure of a document.

## Characterizing microbial communities

## Calculating species richness

asv_counts |> 
  select(depth_10_m) |>
  filter(depth_10_m >= 1) |> 
  nrow()
```

## Quarto

-   Is an open-source tool for scientific and technical publishing.
-   Creates outputs including PDF, Word, HTML reports, books, websites, presentations & more.
-   Keeps analysis and report together by mixing natural language, code and its outputs.
-   Makes content and structure of a document explicit
-   Plain text facilitates collaboration and reproducible workflows

## How Quarto works {background-image="https://cdn.myportfolio.com/45214904-6a61-4e23-98d6-b140f8654a40/b5217f2a-f129-4bf9-90dc-c5b9783d0ea8_rw_3840.png?h=a41d29d8ce363dbc153f3bcc1abe085a" background-size="contain" aria-label="A schematic representing rendering of Quarto documents from .qmd, to knitr or jupyter, to plain text markdown, then converted by pandoc into any number of output types including html, PDF, or Word document."}

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into
a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{{r}}
1 + 1
```
````

-   Metadata as YAML with the format `key: value`
-   Text
-   Code

## Markdown

-   Simple expressive formatting with symbols and text.
-   Used in many [apps and services](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/), for example {{< fa brands discord title="Discord" >}} {{< fa brands slack title="Slack" >}} {{< fa brands github title= "GitHub" >}}

# Universal Design for Learning (UDL):<br>Embracing open source {background-color="#faa928"}

::: notes
[Universal design for learning fellows program](https://tlef.ubc.ca/application/special-call/universal-design-for-learning-fellows-program/)---2024 cohort
UDL strives to provide multiple means for three principles of effective instruction.
:::

## Representation

-   Open source tools support alt text for images.
-   Easy to provide headings and descriptive hyperlinks.

## Engagement

-   Follow the **mastery learning** model, i.e., frequent practice, assessment and feedback.
-   Use online assessment platform (e.g., [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/)) to support mastery learning at scale.
-   Use authentic examples and assessments (for example, ePortfolio)
-   Use relevant, widespread technologies, such as web technologies (HTML, CSS).
-   Model inclusive practices in the way course is run (syllabus) and materials are provided.

## Action and expression

- Alternative ways of participating, e.g., discussion section on course website.
- Increased expression and communication (Quarto offers a lot of flexibility).
